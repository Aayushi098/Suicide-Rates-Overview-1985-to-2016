1.2 Introduction
Suicide is a pressing public health issue that demands our attention and understanding. In this 
project, we explore suicide rates from 1985 to 2016, aiming to shed light on the factors that 
contribute to this global concern. By delving into a comprehensive dataset, we seek to uncover 
patterns and correlations that can provide valuable insights for policymakers, public health 
professionals, mental health experts, researchers, and the general public. Through rigorous analysis 
and data visualization, we aim to make this complex topic more accessible, fostering awareness 
and informing evidence-based strategies to combat suicide rates. Join us on this journey as we 
uncover the multifaceted aspects of suicide and strive to create a safer and healthier future for all. 
Firstly, we will perform an exploratory analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the data, 
uncovering patterns, trends, and potential relationships between variables. This will enable us to 
identify key metrics within the dataset and establish relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
that align with our objectives. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of our findings, we will 
diligently clean, filter, and edit the data according to our specific requirements, addressing any 
inconsistencies or outliers that may impact the analysis. Additionally, we will prioritize data 
quality and validity by thoroughly examining the dataset for errors, redundancies, and missing

Interpretation of Skewness of Dataset:
Suicides_no: Skewness = 10.352910 The distribution of the "suicides_no" column is positively 
skewed (tail on the right side) as the skewness value is significantly greater than 0. This indicates 
a few years with many suicides, resulting in a long right tail.
Population: Skewness = 4.459414 The distribution of the "population" column is positively 
skewed (tail on the right side) as the skewness value is greater than 0. This suggests there are 
relatively few years with very large populations, resulting in a long right tail.
Suicides/100k pop: Skewness = 2.963414 The distribution of the "suicides/100k pop" column is 
positively skewed (tail on the right side) as the skewness value is greater than 0. This indicates a
relatively few years with a high suicide rate per 100k population, resulting in a long right tail.
In summary, most of the columns in the dataset exhibit positive skewness, indicating that the tail 
of the distribution is longer on the right side. This means there are relatively few extreme values 
in the positive direction, which might correspond to years with higher suicides, larger populations, 
or higher suicide rates.
9
Interpretation of Kurtosis:
Suicides_no: Kurtosis = 157.168842 The kurtosis value for the "suicides_no" column indicates 
that the distribution has heavy tails and a sharper peak compared to a normal distribution. This 
suggests the presence of extreme values and a significant deviation from normality.
Population: Kurtosis = 27.407176 The kurtosis value for the "population" column indicates that 
the distribution has heavy tails and a sharper peak compared to a normal distribution. This suggests 
the presence of extreme values and a significant deviation from normality.
Suicides/100k pop: Kurtosis = 12.165745 The kurtosis value for the "suicides/100k pop" column 
indicates that the distribution has heavy tails and a sharper peak compared to a
normal distribution. This suggests the presence of extreme values and a significant deviation from 
normality.
In summary, most of the columns in the dataset exhibit high positive kurtosis, indicating heavytailed distributions with a sharper peak compared to a normal distribution. This suggests
the presence of extreme values and a significant departure from normality, implying that the 
distributions are leptokurtic.
1.5 Recommendations
Improve mental health support: Given the complex nature of suicide rates, it is crucial to prioritize 
mental health support and resources. Governments and healthcare organizations should allocate 
adequate funding and develop comprehensive strategies to provide accessible and affordable 
mental health services. This includes promoting awareness, early intervention, and destigmatizing 
mental health issues to encourage individuals to seek help.

should implement strategies tailored to different demographics, age groups, and risk factors 
identified in the analysis. These strategies may include educational programs, community outreach 
initiatives, and targeted interventions to address different populations' specific needs and 
vulnerabilities.
10
Enhance data collection and reporting: To improve the understanding of suicide rates, it is crucial 
to enhance data collection efforts. Governments should invest in comprehensive and standardized 
data collection systems to ensure accurate and consistent reporting of suicide cases. This includes 
collecting data on important variables such as mental health history, access to means, and 
underlying causes to identify patterns and risk factors more effectively.
Foster international collaboration: Suicide is a global issue that requires collaboration among 
countries. International organizations, governments, and NGOs should collaborate to share best 
practices, research findings, and resources. This collaboration can lead to a more comprehensive 
understanding of suicide rates and development of effective prevention strategies across borders.
1.6 Conclusion
By analyzing the KPIs we can conclude that suicide is a complex public health issue influenced 
by various factors. This analysis has shed light on the relationship between suicide rates and 
variables such as population, human development, GDP per capita, age, and gender. While the 
analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to recognize that suicide is a multifaceted 
problem that requires a comprehensive approach. To effectively address suicide rates, it is essential 
to prioritize mental health support, implement evidence-based prevention strategies, address socioeconomic disparities, enhance data collection efforts, and foster international collaboration. By 
taking a holistic approach and investing in these recommendations, policymakers, public health 
professionals, and communities can work together to create a safer and healthier future for 
individuals worldwide.
